My name is Dmitrii Blokhin. I love modern computer technologies since my first computer when I was 5 years old or so. I am very fond of music, like playing bass (Red hot chilli peppers fan!), piano, keyboard, vocoders, as well as funky guitar rhythms. I lived in Russia and moved to Spain after graduating as a Construction Engineer. Here I studied geotechnical engineering, but failed to finish the final project, as I started to working as a waiter to obtain my residence permit. Then I worked as a construction worker for about a year. Since then, my journey lies in the real estate world, where I try to learn something new and apply modern tech skills. I also do a lot of fitness and acrobatics and like to design my diets with LLM assistance.
